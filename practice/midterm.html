    <p> I took this web design class because it was required in my major, but it doesn't just boil down to that. While it can look hopeless to learn coding, as it is similar to learning a new language, if you can relatively understand it, it opens a door to a world of possibilities. Creating your own layouts and websites is a great asset to have, as in this day and age, having a website can really improve buisness and advertisement of any kind.  </p>
